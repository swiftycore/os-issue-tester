Configuration :

Add your custom hosts in the "websites.ini" file

You can run tests by executing "check", which will simply execute check.php



How to add your tests ?

Add your tests under the app/bysoft/tests/magento/ folder.
You'll have to extend the "\bysoft\_abstract\Test" class and override the "run" method.
